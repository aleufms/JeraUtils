![Jera Utils: The Basic Toolset](http://jera.com.br/images/logo-jera-header@3x.png)

Jera Utils is a pod with all the basic tools we use in most of the apps we build.

It is still under development and being tested as a pod so if you are not a member of Jera's team use it at your own risk.

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```
> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is recommended.

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'JeraUtils', '~> 0.2.0'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Usage

Documentation on how to use this pod is going to be written soon.
